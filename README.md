Have you ever watched Harry Potter film series? If your answer "yes", you know the Daily Prophet newspaper. This is a newspaper which have dynamic photos. In this app, I created the Daily Prophet newspaper. However, the users need to have a physical iOS device such as iPad and iPhone in order to run this app because the Simulator do not have and support the camera function. Before using the app, the users should print the copy of the Daily Prophet newspaper to get efficieny the most. When they show the newspaper to their physical iOS device, the photo is going to start to have a dynamic feature, and the video will play.
